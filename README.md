# Shinobi

Incremental game

## How dev

- Install nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)
- Install latest node, or I'm using `v20.11.0`

```sh
nvm install v20
nvm alias default v20.11.1 # or whatever version it said it installed
```

- Install node_modules, run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Present idea

Presently, my way of moving forward with the project is based on two ideas:

- Shinobi will automatically generate points
- Shinobi will be able to be sent on missions, which will grant them experience but also present some risk in the form of incapacitating them for a while or maybe even losing them entirely

Things are kind of a mess right now. I have had a lot of ideas and have written a lot of throw-away code that I don't want to delete just yet in case I might try to use it again.
